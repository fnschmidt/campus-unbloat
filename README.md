# campus.unbloat.app

CampusUnbloat is the go-to home for any[^1] BA student. It combines both CampusDual and Studentenwerk data into a modern and fast webapp.
This is the frontend and main repository.

[^1]: Hundreds of canteens in Germany are supported thanks to [OpenMensa](https://github.com/openmensa/openmensa), but Studentenwerk Leipzig has 'native' support.

> This project was inspired by the poor condition of campus dual

- wise words by [Simon Nikolaidis](https://github.com/MaRcR11/ba-schedule/commit/882bd3a7d247984c7dded7b2e3b9f8e1bbab54ce).

## Components

**This repo**: SvelteKit-based very cool app.io.dev.sh

ðŸ¦€ [campus-api](https://github.com/greybaron/campus-api): Adapter API for NetWeaver-based CampusDual

ðŸ¦€ [mensa-api](https://github.com/greybaron/mensa-api): Adapter API for Studentenwerk Leipzig Mensae

## Developing

1. Build both APIs

- have a working Rust toolchain (see [here](https://rustup.rs))
- api-mensa:
  - install SQLite3 development files (e.g. `libsqlite3-dev` on Debian)
- run `cargo run` in each root

2. Clone this repo

- `npm i`
- `# CD_API_URL=http://localhost:8080 MENSA_API_URL=http://localhost:9090 npm run dev`
  - these environment variables will likely be fine, but adapt them if necessary

## Building

`Dockerfiles` exist in each repo, and workflows exist which demonstrate what needs to be done
